## Project Type
Interactive Data Analysis & Recommendation Tool

## Questions of Interest
1. How can cosmetic ingredient data be used to recommend products based on individual skin types?
2. Can user ratings improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of product recommendations?
3. How can we design a reusable system that supports better skincare decision-making rather than one-time analysis?

## Goal / Project Output
Our goal is to build an **interactive recommendation tool** that helps users select skincare products suitable for their skin type.

Planned Outputs:
- A web application interface where users input their skin type
- An intelligent matching engine that analyzes ingredient compatibility
- Rating display for transparency
- Reusable recommendation system architecture
- Final report and reproducible analysis notebooks
